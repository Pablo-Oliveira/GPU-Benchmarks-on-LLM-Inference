It is said (I know not how true) to have been visible at sea fourteen days before Paris. When the sun rose there, one morning early in the present month of December, the comet was still blazing away in that orb: but as London and Westminster were already swallowed up by arrangement, no immediate notice appears to have been taken of this omen; although it was afterwards found that a certain number of paper bills of credit, issued under pretence of being pounds sterling, had really the value, upon the spot, of so many pounds of gunpowder. The same cause which, on account of its great utility in the arts and sciences, is now deemed sacred (though the word itself be not sacred), was then held in contempt; for it happened that the paper money was first made a circulating medium by the Bank of England: as if there could have been anything more antireligious than to consider property as consisting merely in pieces of paper. \n",

      "# A CHRISTMAS CARROLL\n",
      "1854\n",
      "Between 1950 and 1763, London was home to Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll)—author of _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ —and his family. His daughter Lorina Hicks (better known as \"Lorina\") was born at 94/5 Wimpole Street on May 26, 1857; she and her brother Reginald were the fifth-generation descendants of Thomas Lutwidge Dodgson. Their father's work took him away for months at a time, but when he was home, it was not uncommon to find him sitting in the back parlor with a quill pen and stacks of paper and envelopes piled up all around him. His letters—always written by hand on fine stationery—were usually full of newsy tidbits from his travels. The Dodgsons were active parishioners at St. Barnabas' Anglican church, which stood a half-mile walk away from their home on the southwest corner of Wimpole Street and Portman Square (it was later replaced by a hospital).\n",
      "Carroll was always the life of every party he attended; even as an adult he could be found performing the same \"turns\" in his early childhood. He loved to tell stories, sing songs, dance around the room, make puns, and play practical jokes—he was once known for putting a cat's tail on a mouse. While out on walks with his friend George MacDonald (who became one of England's most famous writers) he would often get lost in fantastical daydreams about talking animals and magic.\n",
      "He was well educated at Rugby School, Oxford University, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he trained to be an illustrator. While working on his first book, _Alice_ , which he wrote for his young niece Alice (a.k.a. \"Little Topsy\"), he continued to moonlight as a lecturer in mathematics at Christ Church College in Oxford. Carroll was also an avid photographer and a talented chess player; he liked to read and play piano, and enjoyed riding his bicycle with his sisters and their friends, who called themselves the \"Wheels\" of Oxford.\n",
      "At about this same time, Alice's parents were beginning to notice that she was becoming rather moody and difficult at home. Her mother even wrote in her diary: \"We are all very anxious about poor Alice... She seems a changed child.\" The Huxley family eventually realized that their little girl had something wrong with her; they brought her to see Dr. John Langdon Down, who ran the Royal School for Mentally Handicapped Children—the same institution that had been attended by many of Queen Victoria's children and grandchildren. After observing Alice for a few months, he diagnosed her as having an \"atypical form of idiocy.\"\n",
      "But no matter what kind of treatment was suggested, there wasn't anything the Huxleys could do to make their little girl better. There were simply no treatments at this time for people with Alice's disorder; she remained institutionalized until she died in 1872.\n",
      "In his autobiography _Born of Heaven_ , Dr. Langdon Down wrote about how he was inspired to help children after witnessing a young boy called \"Johnny\" at the Royal School for Mentally Handicapped Children in Hampton Court, near\n",

Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs.

      " France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.\u001b[0m England, taking warning by the example and fate of her neighbour, began to set about a similar course; which terminated, however, in a very different manner – as will appear hereafter. The French Revolution was now complete: and had made its way into High Life. \n",
      " France was at this time divided into two portions, called _the kingdom_ (in reference to the ancient monarchy) and _the republic_. The former was composed of the greater portion of that country; the latter occupied Paris chiefly, with some other principal towns. Both were in a state bordering on anarchy, from which they had not yet emerged: while England, which had as yet no Jacobin Clubs (for these did not commence their operations till some time later), was at peace and in high prosperity; but, nevertheless, not without indications of the spirit of change, which was at length to blow up her old institutions. \n",
      " In England it was the custom for great men to be created _Baronets_. Their families were ennobled by patents, and received the title of _Barons_; the individual who held the dignity thus conferred on him being called a _baronet_. The creation of baronets in England, however, is of much earlier date than that of peers; the first Baronets having been created early in the fourteenth century. They were always nominated by the king to fill up vacancies, which might happen from death or other cause, in certain _royal_ offices called the Honours of Scotland. There were likewise certain other public offices which the King might nominate for to persons not belonging to a family already possessed of the dignity. The creation of Baronets was also originally confined to gentlemen whose income did not exceed one hundred pounds per annum; but, at length, this limitation was dispensed with, and almost any gentleman could become one by application to the king, as the number of baronetcies was still limited, though no longer dependent on his revenue. \n",
      " By degrees it happened that men of great wealth were made Baronets by the kings themselves; and when that right was established, then the number of the dignity became in a manner limitless: for they might be created by either the Crown or any person, as long as he had not more than one hundred pounds per annum. This restriction now does away, and it is enough only that he has not more than forty pounds per annum to qualify him for a Baronetage; which is generally conferred upon persons of rank, but not of fortune – the highest dignity in England being bestowed on a Baronetcy. \n",
      " By the last king, all Baroneities had become hereditary: though, by the laws of England, no person could be created Baron or Lord unless he possessed either an Earldom or a Viscounty; but when George III came to the throne, it became his custom to grant Baronetcies, instead of creating them by patent. \n",
      " The most important office connected with Baronets is that of High Sheriff: for which they are qualified. But this duty was first performed by King Henry VIII., and the office is now conferred on persons whose only qualification consists in their being made Baronets: so that no longer, when a vacancy arises in that office, does it depend upon the wealth or other merits of the person; but, if he be a Baronet, he is qualified for High Sheriff. \n",
      " The original distinction between a Baronee and a Baron (now called Lord) was the latter's right to sit in Parliament: which privilege has been denied to the Baronees ever since the Restoration; and it was then that they began to be considered as of inferior rank to Lords, and their office called a Baronie or Baronetcy. \n",
      " In France, they are known as Baron and Baroness; and the title is not hereditary in general: but it sometimes may be: though generally the title expires with the father's life. The only qualification for being made a Baron of France is to have been a Baronee of Spain. \n",
      " A Baron or Lord was formerly an earl, or nobleman who had a barony granted him by the king – but when the French Revolution broke out, a law was passed which deprived them of their rights and privileges: and since that time France has made a distinction between Barons and Lords. The French Lords, however, are not considered as inferior in rank to Barons, for though they can claim no other honours than those which they have by virtue of their ancient titles, yet the privilege of bearing arms has been preserved: nor is this distinction so strongly marked in France now, since many great families still bear their original titles with great honour. \n",
      " Baronesses are never addressed as Lady, nor have they any privileges;\n",

      " France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.\u001b[0m England had been doing the same, by the light of the lantern which led Chatham into the dark; but a powerful party in that country began insensibly to dislike the practice – as if it were not national! The dislike grew and spread, until it became stronger than the propensity: at which point (as is not unusual with such cases) the propensity gave in. The French Revolution was the natural consequence; since which day England has had more real riches, and fewer pretended ones, than any other nation in the world. \n",
      " It happened that this great event of the century occurred exactly at noonday, December the twenty-fifth, on which day General Washington bade farewell to his friends in Virginia (accompanied by a proportionable train of relations), and setting out for New England, took his departure from Mount Vernon. \n",
      " He was not quite clear what it was that he proposed to the people of these States: since it was not the whole object; only as much of it as he could get into one letter. In truth, he had no very explicit notion himself (or at least expressed none) what he should do with it: except that something must be done, and that something, probably, would turn up. \n",
      " The people had hitherto contrived to kill none of their king’s subjects or oppress them by unjust impositions; they now began to show some activity in this way, by imitating a large proportion of his other proceedings (having got it into their heads that royalty was to be done away with). They had not yet arrived at the dark idea of taking arms and establishing a republic; but were merely running wild. \n",
      " Washington set out on the thirtieth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two. It happened to be Storm King’s anniversary: since when that eventful day has been celebrated by the Americans as their Fourth of July (being the fourteenth day of July, seventeen hundred and eighty-two, in which the Declaration of Independence was adopted). \n",
      " The fourth day of July is now the great national festival: – not on account of any services which Washington did or knew of doing on that day, – but because it befell so to fall. And as a sort of compliment to him, they celebrate the day by drinking his health: which is very acceptable to his successor, General Knox (a deaf man), who likes to hear himself talked about. \n",
      " The Americans are a nation of drinkers. They get drunk every day; and have not only no law against getting drunk, but they do it in churches, in meeting-houses, on the floor of Congress, etc., etc., etc. – It is said that when Washington set out from New York with his army (August 15th) for the seat of war at Boston, he took leave of his friends there with a bowl of punch; and that when he went away from them to join General Greene in Virginia, he again bade them good bye with a bowl of punch. In this way they drink their health on all public and private occasions: and are as healthy a people as ever lived. \n",
      " The Americans eat very little bread; but they have an immense quantity of potatoes. There is scarcely any other vegetable which they do not grow in abundance, especially corn (maize), which is their great staple article of food; – and for this reason the United States are called “The Corn Country,” as well as “the bread-basket” of the world. \n",
      " In New York, on the twenty-fourth day of December, in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, there was a most violent storm; which broke down some of the finest houses that ever were seen, in this or any other country: – among others, Mrs. Washington’s. There happened to be no guests at table (excepting a Frenchman); but Mr. & Mrs. Washington, and a number of their children, dined at home upon mince-pies, etc., etc. The family had all got into the large back drawing-room; – where they were playing at backgammon. It was so near night that there was scarcely any light left to see by: but somehow, Washington, finding himself alone by the table (where he was making his last discourse to the company), got up and was going out. \n",
      " While he was in the act of standing up, one of the dogs under the table – which was so dark that he could not see it a great way off – sprang out suddenly with an awful growl: it was enough to have frightened Washington out of his wits: but luckily the dog had no teeth and made\n",

      " France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.\u001b[0m Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands amputated, his nose reinforced by having three inches of bone shaved off, and his right ear cut completely away, who had contested a question in grammar (before a juvenile tribunal) against a party of the great Gaulish nation; to whom the decision was delivered, in this imperious manner, \"The King's heart and the People's heart fail on you. Convict no. 2 is clearly right.\" The great nation went into mourning for him; and the youth was taken off to the hospital where such operations were performed with a perfect coolness of disposition in the surgeon, or rather the head nurse of the institution (who was himself no more than fifteen years old), that one would have believed he had been appointed from his boyhood to this painful office of a knife. \n",
      "As to Britain, at its unhappy crisis of revolt and civil war, it seemed rather like Otho, in the play, elated by his recent victory over Galba, and not yet at all aware of what he was meditating: England, with this difference, that she was neither elate nor yet aware of what she was meditating. On the contrary, she went through a form of penitence and self-depreciation which would have been ridiculous anywhere else, but in her had a peculiar air of sanctimonious hypocrisy: as if the nation, having plunged itself into a war with its own children, must be careful not to do it too effectually. She could afford to sacrifice three hundred thousand lives in a foreign contest; and was so liberal that she made her enemy pay for every shot that was fired on both sides. But when England (in the character of her Parliament) began to cut down her own domestic population,—which she had no right to do at all, because they were not in open rebellion against their country nor even disloyal to it, but merely differing from their rulers as to what constituted its best interest; and when the English people became so madly infuriated by this cruel process of repression (which was only meant for a few years' duration), that they could not keep themselves quiet for an hour,—then indeed it was time to think whether there was any good hope for England.\n",
      "Of all the wars carried on by England at different times in her history, none is more curious than this, because it has been fought with the very people who are called upon to fight them. It may be said that if this war had never taken place, our ancestors would not have learned some important lessons, and we should be far behind our neighbours in all that is worthy of a high-spirited nation.\n",
      "However, it was fought; and it was found at last that the English people were too numerous for their rulers to cut them off, and so they were obliged to allow them some little share in their own affairs; only reserving to themselves the right of controlling this share, as far as their strength would permit.\n",
      "It was, however, a very small beginning on both sides: the Parliament, which had now become established, being very jealous for itself; and the people, who had never been accustomed to any freedom or self-government at all, being too timid to assert themselves, or even think about it.\n",
      "After the Restoration of Charles II., in 1660 (whose father was beheaded by Cromwell's soldiers), the old feudal constitution came back again; with a few new laws added, which were intended as checks on its worst abuses: especially against the power of arbitrary imprisonment.\n",
      "These were not sufficient in themselves to stop these abuses. So, the next thing that was tried by King William and Queen Mary—who were Dutch people—was to create a body called a 'Council of State,' whose members should be appointed by the Crown (meaning by the king and queen), and who should act as a check upon it. This Council did nothing at first but recommend certain things which were very much needed, especially some laws for the better protection of the people; for instance, that all prisoners should have access to lawyers, and also that judges should not be allowed to take bribes. It also recommended a great many other important measures—all of which were passed in Parliament by both king and parliament, only the latter with some slight modifications; though these did not amount to much in themselves.\n",
      "The Council of State was at first composed chiefly of royalists. These, however, were soon replaced by such men as were best fitted for the work it had been created to do;\n",

      "#  **THE FATHER OF SIR NICHOLAS BAGOT**\n",
      "WHO WERE THE TALBOTS?\n",
      "There is not a county in England that does not boast some branch or other of the Talbot family—a race, originally from France (which gives us no great satisfaction), and still more from Scotland. The ancient name was _de Talbois_ , and by this it has been rendered into French, where the title is spelt _Talbott_. The original ancestor of the Bagots was Sir Gilbert de Talbot, who flourished in the reigns of Edward IV, Richard III, Henry VII, and Henry VIII. It was the custom with our ancient warriors to give their sons names expressive of their rank—as for instance, the Dukes of York, Bedford, Gloucester; Sir John de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, etc.; but we have not met with any such examples in the Talbot family. \n",
      "THE TALENTED THREE-CENTURIES OLD GILBERT DE TALBOT\n",
      "The most renowned Talbots were three brothers, called Gilbert, Roger, and William. They belonged to the ancient Talboys (or Talbois) of Lacock in Wiltshire; and it is probable that the name _Gilbert_ , as a patronymic appellation, was very common among their ancestors. The history of these three brothers forms a subject of the most profound interest. We shall begin with the eldest:\n",
      "SIR GILBERT DE TALBOT\n",
      "The father and grandfather of this brave Sir Gilbert de Talbot were both named William; and it was doubtless from this latter that he inherited his knightly title, which is the more remarkable, as it had not been heretofore given to any member of their family. He married Joan, daughter of John, Lord Bromwiche, and by her became the father of a large progeny—amongst whom were the great Sir Gilbert de Talbot (the hero of this narrative), Roger, his second son; William, the third; Richard; Walter; Thomas; Matilda; Margaret; Alice; and Joan. \n",
      "THE ELDER BROTHER, ROGER TALBOT\n",
      "Roger Talbot was a brave knight—and the father of that gallant Sir Robert who is to be so conspicuous in the wars of the Red Rose against the White. He died before his brother, Sir Gilbert; leaving him two sons, Richard and William; but whether he had any other issue remains doubtful.\n",
      "THE YOUNGER BROTHER WILLIAM\n",
      "Sir William de Talbot (the younger son) was a great warrior in the wars of France against King Henry V.; and distinguished himself by his valour in the field, as well as by his loyalty to the Crown. He was with the Earl of Salisbury's division, at the battle of Cressy; but he was also one of those knights who accompanied Henry V., on a secret expedition into France—where they made themselves masters of Paris, in defiance of all its fortifications: and in consequence thereof, Talbot and his brave companions were created Knights of the Garter.\n",
      "In 1423 he was present at the siege of Orleans; and was killed at the storming of that town, which took place on the 7th May 1429.*\n",

      "From the account in his 'Memoirs' by Captain Groves, RN\n",
      "**T** he morning of December 6th was calm, with no wind, but there was a haze hanging over the water. This was unusual at this time of year and the crews of the two ships thought it portentous, although they could see nothing in the sea or sky to suggest why the air should be so damply heavy and laden with vapour.\n",
      "'You should take the helm,' Mr Annesley said to his second captain, Mr Thomas Byam Martin, who had been a lieutenant under him when he was in command of _Gibraltar._\n",
      "Byam shook his head and replied, 'Mr Cozens can steer better than me. He is a far better seaman.'\n",
      "'I never saw the haze like this before,' said Cozens, who had been one of Byam's midshipmen aboard _Gibraltar_ in 1796 and was now a lieutenant. 'I would rather have seen us off Plymouth and into a stiff southwester.'\n",
      "'No wind will not be as bad,' Mr Annesley replied, but the first officer of the other ship said much the same.\n",
      "The ships were at this time close to Cape Trafalgar – only nine miles from where they would fight two days later. The crews had been bidden by Lord Nelson that they might leave their ships with as little noise as possible and walk around without talking or laughing, so that the ships should not be discovered.\n",
      "Because there was no wind to blow their smoke away the ship's boats were sent over the side to spread out a few hundred yards from each other, to see if any sails could be seen on the horizon in that direction – which would show the French fleet was close by.\n",
      "At 9 o'clock a sail appeared and they found it was their consort _Brunswick_.\n",
      "By now, however, Lord Nelson had discovered what he thought was the enemy fleet from his flagship, _Victory_ , and sent Mr Sutherland with instructions to his captains that he was sailing to cut out two of the ships.\n",
      "The other vessels were ordered not to take any more care over their smoke than they would otherwise do – in case the French had discovered it already.\n",
      "Nelson went on, saying that the _San Antonio_ , _Redoutable_ , and the _Santa Anna_ were three Spanish men-of-war whose commanders, having heard of Lord Nelson's signal honour, were likely to join the fleet at sea with a large force in support.\n",
      "These ships could not be seen by either ship because they were hidden in smoke which was already thick around them, but Nelson did say that if he found himself within reach of their fire and was unable to take his revenge upon the _Redoutable_ for having previously captured his _Captain_ , then he would seek out one or two of the merchantmen which accompanied her.\n",
      "In a short time the smoke cloud had become thicker – in fact it was so dense that at first no vessels could be seen beyond 120 yards. The captains were ordered to lie-to, and all three ships began to manoeuvre to avoid collisions.\n",
      "The wind continued to freshen from a light air into a brisk gale – the topgallant sails had been let draw in order to keep as close to the smoke clouds as possible – but with each passing hour it became more and more difficult to see.\n",
      "Nelson's own signal halyards, too, were festooned in black silk ropes that hung from their tops every which way like a web of spiders' legs.\n",
      "Yet he could not see the enemy even though his flagship _Victory_ was now only four miles away from them.\n",
      "Then it was suddenly as if one ship, at least, had broken free from this cloak of darkness.\n",
      "It appeared to be coming on fast towards him – its hull and masts standing out clear against the sea.\n",
      "Nelson looked through his telescope and could make out that it was flying French colours.\n",

      "IT WAS the dark hour before dawn, on a day in the latter end of February 1775, that Mr Jarvis Lorry sat waiting by a wretched hearth in an miserable room of the post-tavern in Portsmouth, though no fire was in it. A group of dirty children playing about him and the wainscoted walls were stained brown by age and smoke; while old cobwebs swung from the beams above; and spiders large and small haunted the shadows. An ancient clock with a peal button, which could have been pulled to tell its age, if it had not been made an exception to every other clock in the universe, by always going too fast, was fidgeting away like a live thing at no great distance; while several sallow candles in as many bottles were burning dimly at the upper end of the room. The only two individuals in this place who had any flavour of brightness about them (apart from Mr Lorry), were a young lady, and an elderly gentleman; who sat by a dull little window with a bit of cold pork between them which they had been eating as they came along the road. They were so absorbed in their supper (being a long-delayed one) that they did not observe until called to it, how Mr Lorry stirred his tea, and lifted his head, and sat listening, as if he heard a voice outside. \"What is it?\" asked Defarge in an under-tone, removing with her lips the pie she had been eating, but without removing her eyes from it. \"Nothing,\" said Mr Lorry; but each succeeding sound seemed to confirm his suspicion that someone was approaching along the street. He listened and listened, until he could bear it no longer; then got down on his knees behind a settle on which the young lady sat, put his head against the back of her chair, and took off his hat to be ready. A footstep was now distinctly audible--a footstep coming from Mr Lorry's direction, along the street. \"There is some one at the door,\" said he, looking round at Defarge: who had risen under pretence of being alarmed at his movements; and had also taken off her hat and gloves, that she might be ready. The footstep came on slowly and heavily, as if the person were somewhat unwilling to advance. Mr Lorry's door was open, and there was a light burning in the room. When whoever it was, came to the bottom of the stairs, Mr Lorry saw him stop there for a little while; and heard him blowing his nose. \"Aha!\" thought Mr Lorry, swinging his hat. \"I know that voice!\" It's dreadful hard,\" said Jerry, with his mouth full, after he had swallowed his fourth bit of the cake as they walked along: and when he had concluded a searching look at the sky, and had shaken\n",

      " France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.\u001b[0m Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is not improbable that in the rough timber of some Saxon gallows, on the rude scaffolding of some citizen's execution, or in the yet ruderer nooses of the public streets, there were growing tree destined to be made into ships that would carry the Conqueror and his host from Normandy to England. That wooden sword was a fairy gift to the soldier who first wielded it against the Saracens, at the siege of Damascus; but if he could have looked forward through some four hundred years, perchance he might have thought twice before he drew it out of the scabbard.\n",
      "The Puritan ran his eye over the leaves of his old-f- fashioned little red prayerbook, and seemed to gather moral courage from their devotional contents. \"Yes,\" he said, getting up a light for himself, \"I'll have him now. Ring the bell there!\" His words had no sooner passed his lips than it rang. He walked straight out as it was ringing, opened the door of the room across the staircase, looked in, listened, and all to no purpose.\n",
      "\"What! See him?\" repeated Mr. Tugby, with an air of wonder. \"No. Why should you see him?\"\n",
      "Mr. Tugby took the light, went slowly over it, shook his head, took off his spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again to have another look at a line or two, then handed them back to Mr. Cobbett with the observation \"Seems a strange sort of thing.\"\n",
      "\"Why do you make yourself miserable?\" he said. \"If you'll be advised by me, you'll keep what you are and where you are, till some new customers come in to take your fancy or fit your purse. You will be worse off anywhere else. Don't run your head into trouble.\"\n",
      "\"I am sorry,\" said the Puritan, \"to hear you say so.\"\n",
      "\"Well, well!\" he returned, with a good-natured shrug. \"Anybody can do that, you know. Anybody can say they are sorry when they're not. But it does no harm for you to try your chance if you like; only don't come crying to me afterwards that I told you so.\"\n",
      "\"God bless you, sir!\" returned the other with a fervency that went beyond his meaning, and made the bookseller stare at him. \"You have warned me in good season. I shall be more careful another time--indeed I shall. And yet,\" said Cobbett, faltering again; \"I am not sure, even now, that I may not be brought to this again. If it was to be done over again to-morrow, I have a strong misgiving that I should do the selfsame thing.\"\n",
      "The little back parlour of the bookseller's house in Pye Street, Westminster, was his workshop and his private room; no other lodger had any business there. But two visitors at once were sufficient to render it too small for comfort.\n",
      "Mr Walters, the keeper of a library, having occasion to consult Cobbett upon certain new publications, entered this sanctum sanctorum one raw March afternoon with that object in his view; while Mr Lillyvick, who was also connected with the trade (in fact he had come into it by inheritance), and who was at present in want of a little ready money to help him out of some difficulty or other, found himself so fortunate as to arrive immediately afterwards.\n",
      "\"How do you do, gentlemen both!\" cried Cobbett from his seat behind the counter. \"Sorry I ain't more comfortable to offer you. It's cramped here with two; but there an't no help for it now, I see.\"\n",

      " France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.\u001b[0m Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and fire applied to his body in order to burn out his sinful stains which nothing else would reach. It was enough for any one man to understand the blood on his own head. When the promptings of nature pleaded against it, that tended to make it wise in him to keep them down. \n",
      " Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them. This is the principle on which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle on which I bring up these children. Stick to Facts, sir!' \n",
      " The scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a school-room, barred and dungeoned like a prison, and diversified with little else than broad desks and benches, blackboard and globe, wandering every hour or two an ugly muggy idol of a schoolmaster, who went up to his altar, smelt at his cold potatoes, and came down again. Pyjamas peeped into group of stockingless boys upon the floor improving their time by cutting out paper babies from their old spelling-books—and with an air that seemed to ask him whether he liked it. \n",
      "'Give me Facts,' said the teacher, emphasizing the word with his cane. \n",
      " 'Plenty of Facts.' \n",
      " 'Heap of Facts.' \n",
      " 'Pile of Facts.' \n",
      " 'My dear Pyjamas!' said the teacher in a most amiable manner.  \n",

      " 'That's the answer for you,' retorted the sturdy Teacher. 'Facts! Facts alone are wanted in life. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them. This is a fact, Pyjamas, that I am not going to allow you or any other boy to call me names. Very well, then! Take that, and that!'  \n",
      "He took those, and several more of the same sort, without flinching from the Teacher though they often drew blood; but he was much too exalted by his success in life to care for such trifles. He cared so little for them, indeed, that he came back next day under pretty nearly the same circumstances as those in which he had gone away, and was not only sent for, and informed upon, again, but ordered to produce a sample of his handwriting. \n",
      " 'It is much more probable,' said the Teacher, getting up and putting his hands into his pockets, after contemplating Pyjamas's work all this time, 'that you will never learn to spell than that your ever doing so will be any credit to your teacher or yourself.' \n",
      " 'Do you spell well?' he demanded in a severe voice.  \n",
      " 'No, sir!' said Pyjamas.  \n",
      " 'A very good answer, too,' said the Teacher. 'Do you mean to say, Pyjamas, that they never gave you regular lessons at school? \n",
      " 'Yes, sir!' said Pyjamas.  \n",
      " 'And were you perfect in spelling?'  \n",
      " 'No, sir!'  \n",
      " 'Nor I, either,' said the Teacher. 'And yet I'm not ashamed of being able to spell better than you, who can't spell at all.' \n",
      " This was a riddle Pyjamas could make nothing of, for a minute or two. After that, he began to think he saw the way out.  \n",
      " 'I do,' said Pyjamas. 'I'm sure I ought to be able to do it! \n",
      " The Teacher looked at him for some minutes without speaking, and indeed without seeming to see him, but at last roused himself with a deep sigh. \n",
      " He went out to play in the court where his brother was digging like a dog. There were several other little boys of his own age there; none of whom he knew, and none of whom would speak to him. He played sadly enough until he knew that he was wanted in the schoolroom again. Then he returned to it, and tumbled into his place without looking up – quite tired of himself and sullen. \n",

      " France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.\u001b[0m Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution.\n",
      "But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.\n",
      "In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the road-agents, it was said, took the numbers of bank notes from a cash-box in an office in Fleet Street, and cashed the same at a banking house in the country. A mail-coach was 'stuck up' between Hick's Hall and Shooter's Hill, and the guard robbed of two thousand pounds. Another was robbed in the city, by a man dressed in crape: who talked so much about his mother and his wife and eight children, that the guard suspected nothing until he had shot him through the head with a blunderbuss. A day or two later, five men attacked another mail-coach close to town, but were fired at by the guard through the roof of the vehicle, until all his ammunition (an unusual store) was expended; then, drawing a sword from under his seat, and shouting to his fellow outside to 'come and take that,' he laid about him so lustily with the blade, that two of the robbers were run through the body, and one of them killed. And concerning the perpetrator of another robbery at Hampstead, upon the northern road, a reward of fifty guineas was offered for his apprehension; but whether he ever received his deserts or not, does not appear.\n",
      "These occurrences are gleaned from the newspapers published at this time: but similar offences were so common in and about London then, as always to be fresh in men's minds, and to have become incorporated with the national character. There were highwaymen in Ireland too; but Mr Dennis Haggarty had left that country expressly to improve his manners by rubbing against a superior order of society in England.\n",
      "The gentleman who had just been robbed and murdered by this amiable outlaw, was an Irish merchant in London: and on the very day when that crime was committed, a certain Mr Tigg made some small advances on his personal property at a broker's shop. That night he failed; but being too cautious a man to sleep at home under such circumstances, or rather knowing too well that a bed was no longer his own, and that he must be 'on the lay,' as they say, he had taken up his quarters for the time being in Covent Garden Market. It was about three o'clock in the morning when he went out stealthily to look at the state of the weather; and coming back again with an ugly lowering face, he ordered some hot punch by way of stimulant to the brave spirit that sustained him.\n",
      "He had a man sitting up with him all night; for although the creditors were not likely to break in until next day, when it would be broad noon with Mr Tigg, he deemed it expedient to be cautious. This friend was busily employed in compounding various ardent spirits at the fire\n",

It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be labeled as 'the Carriage of the Marquis de Sade' some fifty years later.

In France, at the date of the story which is now beginning to be told, there lived a Doctor Manette who was imprisoned in the Bastille because his son had sent a certain message from London to Paris which displeased the authorities in Paris. This message was: 'Beware! One hundred and fifty thousand people stand ready to rise against you if you dare approach their liberties!' But, because it came from England, it was treated as a joke; so Doctor Manette rotted away in the Bastille for eighteen years--from old age forty-two when he entered, to seventy when he came out.\n",

      "A prosperous old gentleman, who knows how to be satisfied with his own company, lives here in these shady arts and gloomy rooms behind the Bank of England, in the heart of the City of London; and if he dines well, and goes to bed early, he does it here. He is told by the people about him that he shuts himself up too much, but he shrugs his shoulders at that, for he has seen a good deal of most things and is tired of them.\n",

It would be far more agreeable to look up at the sky than at Mr. Lorry's heavy nose and rather dull eyes, but she is polite enough not to say so, or even to seem to think so.\n",

      " France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.\u001b[0m Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrels of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.\n",
      "In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the Captain,” politely excused himself in the most circumstantial manner, alleging that he had “not been near him,” and giving up his acquaintance afterwards with greatest heartiness on the smallest pretext. Moreover, all the mail-coaches going out of London were provided with certain swords for the use of post-office officers in case of necessity, and the harness of the leader of each pair of horses had a blunderbuss slung under it loaded with ball: because of the daring exploits of highwaymen.\n",
      "Our old friend Sir John Fielding was still alive, but he was growing infirm in body though not in mind; his sight was so weak that he could scarcely distinguish one face from another. The people respected him as much as ever, nevertheless, and believed in a manly feeling and rough eloquence of which he had long been destitute. In this last stage of his honourable career it was his custom to preside in the Bow Street office, seated in an arm-chair with a screen on his lap and his hand upon that; to ask questions of the affrighted witnesses who appeared there; and to express his opinion privately in a few emphatic words, which were noted down by his deputy and issued to the public.\n",
      "The Bow Street office was more crowded than ever, and its business had enormously increased; but that of another office had long outstripped it. This was Thames Police Office, established down on the river-side among the shipping, in those days when smuggling was rife and the revenue cruisers were often chased ashore by the desperate free traders—a sport at which all London used to turn out, routing for the lighter boat. It was natural that the waterside population should resort to this office more readily than to any other, and it soon became famous as the place where any man might be found or any job done, connected with the river. Here you could obtain information of skippers who wanted hands to work their vessels out of harbour; of watermen disengaged for an hour or a night; of lightermen on the look-out for jobs; of boats and barges to let or buy or sell, by the day or week. Here you could ascertain what goods were being unladed where, how many ships had arrived from this port or that, which wharves would be crowded at such an hour and which deserted, which warehouses were full and which nearly empty, what colliers or corn-ships were shortly expected, at what quays the vessels of any particular country were usually moored.\n",
